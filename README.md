# Cryptography
Cryptography deals with encrypting or encoding a piece of information (in a plain text) into a form that looks gibberish and makes little sense in ordinary language.
This encoded message(also called ciphertext) can then be decoded back into a plain text by the intended recipient using a decoding technique (often along with a private key) communicated to the end-user. <br>
Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher, in which each letter in the plain text is replaced by another letter at some fixed positions from the current letter in the alphabet.
